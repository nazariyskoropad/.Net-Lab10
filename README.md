As the big task contained smaller tasks that could conflict with each other, I created different classes to solve this problem. For example class "StaticRectangle" means that this class is static. Class "Figure1" in task 2 means that this class was created to solve task 2.1, class "Figure2" - to solve task 2.2 and so on.
